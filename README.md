# MA_Results

Contains the results of an autologistic regression modelling of the vertical stability and horizontal diffusibility of lexical concepts with different model settings. The respective rankings contain information on semantic field and part-of-speech of the concepts where available. 'Correlations' contains the Spearman rank correlations between different stability rankings from the literature and the results found in 'Rankings'.

**How to read the file names:**
 + o: Model variant with unweighted input
 + w: Model variant with weighted input
 + u: Model variant without the universality parameter
 + d: Model variant with disjoint input

**How to read the rankings:**
 + vi: Vertical stability
 + hi: Horizontal diffusibility
 + vi-hi: Vertical stability minus horizontal diffusibility. Constitutes the basis for ranking.
